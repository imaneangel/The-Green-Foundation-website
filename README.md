# The Green Foundation website

# Introduction
The Green Foundation invites bids to design and build its public website. 

# About the organisation
The Green Foundation was founded in August 2005 and is a non-profit organisation that aims to assist and uplift rural communities with the support of environmental projects. We have raised more than R 4 million to date and have won the Hope Award in 2007 and 2010. To date, we have assisted 45 rural communities in South Africa, Botswana and Zambia and planted more than 30,000 trees. For a full outline of our projects per area, please see our project booklet, attached.

Our staff currently includes two full time project coordinators, a marketing coordinator and five administrative staff members. We also have four part time volunteers during various stages of the year.

Our main message is that poverty and environmental degradation are intrinsically linked. By educating communities to respect the environment, opportunities for income generation are created.

# Target audience

a.	The general public. 75% of our funding comes from individuals who hear about our message through our marketing channels. The remainder comes from corporate sponsorship and internal profit generation (such as fundraising activities and sale of our branded merchandise).

b.	Businesses. Businesses contribute 15% to our funding. We would like to strengthen our focus on corporate sponsorship during 2011 and use the website to support co-branded sponsorship projects like the SASA green campaign.

c.	Volunteering students. Once a year we run a volunteer program in conjunction with Rand University. Social studies students donate 100 hours of their time to an NGO of their choice as part of their year-end thesis. We typically receive 500 hours donated each year. The website should act as a recruitment drive for these volunteers, as well as other non-student volunteers.

d.	Accreditation agencies. We are in the process of securing accreditation from Charity Navigator and ECFA. A professional web presence will assist in this evaluation.

e.	Partners. We are continually expanding our partnership network to environmental organisations and lateral NGOs. The website should act as a vehicle to strengthen our network.

f.	Employees. The strength of our efforts relies on the quality of our people. We would like the website to attract job applications from qualified individuals in the fields of marketing, accounting and project management. The website should advertise the uniqueness of our offering.

g.	Photographers. Photographers typically spend 40 hours a year to profile our projects. They are selected on a competitive basis but often donate free hours to capture specific projects and events. We would like the ‘photo blog’ (see below) to inspire professional photographers to get involved.

h.	Design students. We sell branded merchandise (t-shirts, caps and bags) in our online shop as part of our fundraising. The designs and illustrations are donated by designers and design students. We would like the site to attract further contributions in this area. An online competition platform would be ideal.

g. Media. We have been featured in a variety of local magazines and radio stations. We would like the website to attract further positive media attention and enable interested parties to download our press kits.

# Competitor websites
Competitor website worth referencing are:

Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation - http://www.gatesfoundation.org/
We like the home page banner animation, the breadth of information as well as the extensive use of multimedia throughout the site. The world map on the home page is a good reference for the interactive project map.

Plant with Purpose - http://www.plantwithpurpose.org/
We like the design of the website as well as the interactive village feature.

# Design


In terms of the design, we like the following visual references:

https://github.com/imaneangel/The-Green-Foundation-website/blob/master/Design%202.png


The design should be clean and ‘organic-looking’. We are leaning towards green as the dominant hue together with neutral colours like beige and grey. We would like to feature a mixture of object and people-based photography. A disk with project photos will be supplied but stock photography may need to be sourced where there are gaps.

The home page design should tie in with our main message, which is:

Uplifting communities through environmental projects

Where people photography is concerned, a mixture of races and ages should be represented.

# Other requirements


We are looking for an affordable and reliable hosting solution. We require 500 MB of disk space and up to 10 GB monthly traffic. This excludes email hosting. We already have a domain secured.
